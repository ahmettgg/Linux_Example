# shellscript
The goal of this exercise is to create a shell script that adds users to the same Linux system as the  script is executed on

Scenario:  
Imagine that you're working as a Linux System Administrator for a fast growing company.  The latest  company initiative requires you to build and deploy dozens of servers.  You're falling behind  schedule and are going to miss your deadline for these new server deployments because you are  constantly being interrupted by the help desk calling you to create new Linux accounts for all the  people in the company who have been recruited to test out the company's newest Linux-based  application.    In order to meet your deadline and keep your sanity, you decide to write a shell script that will create  new user accounts.  Once you're done with the shell script you can put the help desk in charge of  creating new accounts which will ﬁnally allow you to work uninterrupted and complete your server  deployments on time.

In order to meet your deadline and keep your sanity, you decide to write a shell script that will create new user account and automatically generate a password for each of new account. Once you're done with the shell script you can put the HR in charge of creating new accounts which will finally allow you to work uninterrupted and complete your server deployments on time. 

Your script accepts user account name and comments as parameter. Then create a new user and a password for them. At the same time, you want users to change their password, when they login the system at the first time.
